# docs/STATE.md is the only record of where the work is, and CLAUDE.md says to
# read it first. Printing it here makes that automatic. The README's open
# claims and the working tree come with it, because a session that starts on a
# dirty tree or a topic branch should know at once.
#
# Whatever a SessionStart hook prints to stdout is added to the context.
# A compaction keeps its own summary, so nothing is printed then.
